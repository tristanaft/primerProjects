Ok, I have to write down some strings
in this document to be able to query them,
it would be nice to be able to remove punctuation
but I haven't implemented that yet and it would probably
be a big pain. Maybe not though.
Hopefully the code will all compile and work fine first try
but that is unlikely.
I have probably spent more time on this last 
section of chapter fifteen than any other part of the book.
I have spent hours trying to figure out why I keep getting errors.
I don't think it has been particularly informative.
I just think that somewhere, I have messed up some include statement
and somehow that keeps screwing up all of my code.
